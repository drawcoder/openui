## 1. Judge Contract And Scoring

- [x] 1.1 Extend the eval judge rubric to define supported `visual_issues` tags and explicitly cap `layout_coherence` for visible overlap, clipping, crowding, direction mismatch, whitespace imbalance, and weak hierarchy.
- [x] 1.2 Update judge response parsing and eval types so `visual_issues` is normalized against the supported allowlist and defaults to an empty array when omitted or malformed.
- [x] 1.3 Add or update unit tests for judge parsing and rubric-facing contract behavior, including backwards compatibility when historical results do not contain `visual_issues`.

## 2. Aggregation And Output Surfacing

- [x] 2.1 Extend failing-pattern aggregation to derive issue-specific patterns from repeated `visual_issues` tags while preserving existing dimension-based summaries.
- [x] 2.2 Update task-bundle generation so `targets.json`, summary artifacts, and copied judge results preserve per-fixture `visual_issues`.
- [x] 2.3 Update the report app to display per-fixture visual issue tags and aggregate issue-level patterns without breaking older run data.

## 3. Validation And Regression Coverage

- [x] 3.1 Add or update eval-loop tests that cover visual-issue aggregation, task-bundle serialization, and report compatibility with missing `visual_issues`.
- [ ] 3.2 Run targeted eval verification against known visual-failure fixtures such as `byte-large-values` and `percentage-as-decimal` to confirm the judge now reports visual diagnostics and lowers layout scores appropriately.
- [x] 3.3 Run the relevant package test suite or targeted eval tests and document any remaining calibration gaps before implementation is considered complete.

## Validation Notes

- `pnpm exec vitest run src/__tests__/e2e/eval src/__tests__/e2e/report.test.ts` passed in `packages/react-ui-dsl`.
- Targeted eval verification was re-run for `byte-large-values` (`20260428_165917_s499`) and `percentage-as-decimal` (`20260428_165920_cbe1`).
- After tightening the rubric for vertical stacking and whitespace imbalance, `percentage-as-decimal` was re-run as `20260428_172259_ok08` and now scores `overall = 5`, `layout_coherence = 2`, with feedback explicitly calling out vertical stacking, excessive whitespace, and weak grouping.
- Remaining calibration gap: both fixtures currently render without the severe visual overlap shown in the original bug report, so the judge returned `visual_issues: []` and kept `layout_coherence: 3` for those fresh runs.
- Historical and synthetic coverage now verify the structured `visual_issues` contract, issue aggregation, task-bundle serialization, and report compatibility, but a reproducible visual-failure fixture is still needed to fully close 3.2.
